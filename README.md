# VDS-V2_1-Software
This is the repository for River City Rocketry's Variable Drag System (VDS) embedded software. It currently runs on a Teensy 3.6 microcontroller, uses a BMP180 pressure sensor for altitude, and uses a BNO055 9DOF sensor for acceleration. The software has been successfully tested in subscale launches, verifying the effectiveness of the sensors, velocity algorithm, and Kalman filter. Current (12/28/2016) efforts are focused on optimizing the SD card storage and implementing software for VDS drag blade actuation.
